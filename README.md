# Review

This is my review of JE McDermott et al., *Prediction of multi-drug resistance transporters using a novel sequence analysis method*,
F1000Research 2015, doi: [10.12688/f1000research.6200.1](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.6200.1)

## Claims

The authors claim to implement a linguistic-based approach that allows the identification of functional patterns
from groups of functionally related proteins. The method uses regular-expressions that are generated using
a parse-tree that is modified via a genetic algorithm, and fitness is scored by accuracy using training data.

After application to ser-thr binding and zinc fingers, the authors apply the method to multi-drug transporters
and the genome of a high-temperature bacteria to explore the potential of finding novel MDR genes
that could result from lateral transfer.
